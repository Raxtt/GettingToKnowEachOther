                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p> 
                I am currently a junior at Lewis University Studying Computer Science as my major. I also bowl for the Lewis University Men's Bowling Team.
                I have been interested in Computers since middle school when my best friend dragged me to a coding class cause he didn't want to go alone.
                After joinging that club I have done various different things related to computer sceince and also got into building them. In total I think I have
                built about 8 computers for friends and family. I am also the second oldest in my family, I have an older sister and two younger brothers. 
            </p>

            <p>
                One of my favorite things to do is bowl. As I already talked about how I am bowling for the Lewis team. I have been bowling for a very long time
                from all the way from 2nd grade to now. I enjoy it in a competitive/sport sense and a casual night out with friends way to. 
                I have also bowled for my highschool team too. We managed to take home 2 state trophies while I was there 2nd and 3rd.
